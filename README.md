# Nearkey (previously known as Virkey)
Nearkey aims to be a professional access control device using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). 

Official site: [www.nearkey.io](https://www.nearkey.io)

## Use cases
* Garage door opener.
* Safe switch.
* Clocking machine.

## Main characteristics
- Asymmetric encryption algorithm ([libsodium](https://download.libsodium.org/doc/))
- Unlimited users per device.
- Over-the-Air (OTA) firmware updates. The updates are transparent through users normal utilization. For example, when users open a garage door they send firmware chunks transparently. When all chunks are received, Nearkey hardware switches to new firmware version.
This feature is crucial to fix potential security or functionality flaws.
- Supports complex time restriction rules.
- Android and iOS app (they are free but not open-source right now).

## Flash your board with precompiled images
First you must install [esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool).

Go to `bin` directory located in Nearkey working directory.
Run this command replacing COM_PORT with the correct com port and BOARD_XXX.bin with the correct board file.
```
esptool.py --chip esp32 --port COM_PORT --baud 115200 --before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash -z --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 40m --flash_size detect 0x1000 bootloader.bin 0x10000 BOARD_XXX.bin 0x8000 partitions.bin
```

If you want erase full flash before flashing Nearkey (YOU WILL LOSE PREVIOUS CONFIGURATIONS), run this command:
```
esptool.py --chip esp32 --port COM_PORT --baud 115200 erase_flash
```
## Compile sources
Follow [esp-idf](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) install instructions.

Nearkey uses version 3.0 of esp-idf. So you must checkout this branch on esp-idf working directory.
 ```
 git checkout release/v3.0
 git submodule update
 ```
 If you want reproduce the same official binary, you must checkout esp-idf to commit referred in [idfver](https://github.com/nayarsystems/nearkey/blob/master/idfver) file.

 "master" branch points to last stable release. Development unstable code lives in "develop" branch.

Once esp-idf is installed, you must select the right board.
On Nearkey's working directory:
```
$ make menuconfig
--> Component config
    --> Virkey.com config
        --> Board
```
Compile and flash:

```
$ make -j4
$ make erase_flash
$ make flash
```
Execute `make monitor` after successful flash if you want see Nearkey's debug output.

## Using Nearkey
After successful flash, launch Nearkey APP and follow instructions to add your device to your account.
You can also manage your account with the web manager [here](https://admin.nearkey.io)
